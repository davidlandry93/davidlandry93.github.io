  There is a high demand and expectation for subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) prediction, which provides forecasts beyond 2 weeks, but less than 3 months ahead. To assess the potential benefit of artificial intelligence (AI) methods for S2S prediction through better postprocessing of ensemble prediction system outputs, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) coordinated a prize challenge in 2021 to improve subseasonal prediction. The goal of this competition was to produce the most skillful forecasts of precipitation and 2-m temperature globally averaged over forecast weeks 3 and 4 and over weeks 5 and 6 for the year 2020 using artificial intelligence techniques. The top three submissions, described in this article, succeeded in producing S2S forecasts significantly more skillful than the bias-corrected ECMWF operational reference forecasts, particularly for precipitation, through improved calibration of the ECMWF raw forecast outputs or multimodel combination. These forecast improvements should benefit the use of S2S forecasts in applications.
